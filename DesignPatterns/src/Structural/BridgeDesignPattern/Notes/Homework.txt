Use of Bridge pattern via following example in which a circle can be drawn in different colors using same abstract class
 method but different bridge implementer classes.

Hints to implement:

Write a DrawAPI interface which is acting as a bridge implementer and concrete classes RedCircle, GreenCircle implementing the DrawAPI interface. 
Shape is an abstract class and will use object of DrawAPI. BridgePatternDemo, our demo class will use Shape class to draw different colored circle.
