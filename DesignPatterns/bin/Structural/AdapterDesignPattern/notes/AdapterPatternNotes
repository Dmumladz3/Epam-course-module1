Adpater Pattern :
    The adapter design pattern is a structural design pattern that allows two unrelated/uncommon interfaces to work together. 
 In other words, the adapter pattern makes two incompatible interfaces compatible without changing their existing code.
 
 If we take a real world example, we cant insert a pendrive into a mobile device. And for that we use external device, OTG. OTG works as "adapter" which helps in read or write the data from the mobile.
 
 In the same manner, Adapter patterns use a single class (the adapter class) to join functionalities of independent or incompatible interfaces/classes.
 
 Interfaces may be incompatible, but the inner functionality should match the requirement.
 
The adapter pattern is often used to make existing classes work with others without modifying their source code.

Suppose we have a project of drawing, in which we are required to develop different kinds 
of geometric shapes that will be used in the Drawing via a common interface called  Shape.


Difference Between Adapter and Decorator Pattern:
Adapter pattern makes a wrapper (Adapter) to create compatibility/conversion from one interface to the other interface which are incompatible. Wrapper (Adapter) works on two incompatible interfaces/classes.

Decorator Pattern makes a wrapper (Decorator) to add/modify functionalities in the interface/class without changing the original code of the class. We use Abstract wrapper to implement this pattern, in general. Wrapper (Decorator) works on single interface/class.
